            <li><strong>Programming</strong>
                <p>I have been in love with programming since the beginning of high school. My father has been one of my biggest influence, because one of his sidejobs is web development and SEO. The first language I got to know was python and it was the one with which I did my finals as well, in my opinion it's one of the best script languages, easy and fun to use from the solving of easier everyday problems to AI development. I would really like to dig deeper in AI in the future but before that I need to broaden my programming knowledge. Furthermore in the summer I started to get familiar with C# by using Unity. My biggest project was <a href="https://www.swparks.hu">SWParks Hungary</a>. It was an idea that was born in me and one of my classmates head to create a website that will have all the Hungarian street workout parks, the site is alive but unfortunately we stopped the project halfway. Maybe we will get back to it in the future, who knows what the future holds? :)</p>
